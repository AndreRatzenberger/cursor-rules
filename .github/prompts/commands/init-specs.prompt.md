# Command Prompt for Coding Agent: Specs Validation and Initialization

## Objective

Ensure the project has a properly structured specifications system by checking for and initializing the `.project/specs` directory and the `SPECS.md` index file.

## Steps

1. **Check for Valid Specs Structure:**
    - Verify if the `.project/specs` directory exists.
    - Check if the `SPECS.md` index file exists in the `.project` directory.

2. **Initialize if Missing:**
    - If either component is missing, create the necessary directory structure and files.
    - Create the `.project/specs` directory if it doesn't exist.
    - Create the `SPECS.md` index file with proper formatting if it doesn't exist.

3. **Report Status:**
    - Inform the user about the current status of the specs structure.
    - Provide confirmation that initialization was successful, if performed.

## Example Implementation

```markdown
## Specifications Structure Check

Checking for specifications directory and index file...

- `.project/specs` directory: {STATUS}
- `.project/SPECS.md` index file: {STATUS}

{ACTION_TAKEN}

The specifications system is now properly initialized. You can now:
- Create new specifications with `spec create [name]`
- Update existing specifications with `spec update [name]`
- List all specifications with `spec list`
```

## SPECS.md Template

If initialization is needed, create the SPECS.md file with the following template:

```markdown
# Project Specifications

This document serves as an index of all specifications for the project. Each specification is linked below with a brief description.

## Specifications List

| ID | Title | Status | Completion | Last Updated |
|----|-------|--------|------------|--------------|
<!-- New specifications will be added here -->

## How to Use This Document

- Each specification has a unique ID and is stored in the `.project/specs/` directory
- Specifications define the requirements and acceptance criteria for project features
- Use the commands `spec create`, `spec update`, and `spec list` to manage specifications
```
