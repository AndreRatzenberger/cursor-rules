# User Request Specifications Recorder

<rule>
name: request_specs_recorder
description: Automatically categorize and write user request specifications to .cursor/specs by domain
filters:
  - type: event
    pattern: "user_request"

Everytime the user asks you to implement something create a "specs"-file which will describe every spec to do.

Write up the specifications into the ".cursor/specs/" folder with each domain topic (including technical topic) as a seperate markdown file. Create a "SPECS.md" in the root of the directory which is an overview document that contains a table that links to all the specs.

Stuff that gets implemented has to be exist as spec, else you are not allowed to implement the feature and ask if something needs to be added to the specs first.
